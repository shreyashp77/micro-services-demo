# Contributing to Microservices Demo

We welcome contributions! Please follow these guidelines to ensure a smooth process.

## Development Workflow

1.  **Fork & Clone**: Fork the repo and clone it locally.
2.  **Branching**: Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`).
3.  **Code Style**:
    *   **Java**: Follow standard Google Java Style Guide.
    *   **Python**: Follow PEP 8.
    *   **Commits**: Use clear, imperative commit messages (e.g., "Add unit tests for OrderService").
4.  **Testing**:
    *   Ensure all unit tests pass: `mvn test`.
    *   If adding a new feature, include a corresponding test case.
5.  **Pull Request**: Push to your fork and submit a PR to the `main` branch.
